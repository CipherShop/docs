## ERC-721

ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs. NFTs are not only of ERC-721 type; they can also be ERC-1155 tokens.

## Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, Ether is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization. Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.

## Express.js

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

## Framework

In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software.

## Front-end

Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.

## Fortmatic

Fortmatic is an easy-to-use alternative to web3 wallets like Metamask. It allows users to use a phone number or email address to connect to Ethereum-based applications, all without the need for a browser extension. Fortmatic has since rebranded to Magic.

## GitHub

GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

## IPFS

The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.

## Layer-1 blockchain

A layer-1 blockchain is a set of solutions that improve the base protocol itself to make the overall system a lot more scalable. There are two most common layer-1 solutions, and these are the consensus protocol changes as well as sharding.

## Layer-2 blockchain

Layer 2s are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, keeping transactions secure, speedy, and scalable. Each individual solution has its own pros and cons to consider such as throughput, gas fees, security, scalability, and of course functionality.

## MetaMask

MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.

## Middleware functions

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform the following tasks: Execute any code. Make changes to the request and the response objects.

## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## npm

npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

## Off-chain transactions

Off-chain transactions refer to those which occur outside of the blockchain itself.

## On-chain transactions

On-chain transactions are transactions that occur on a blockchain that are reflected on the distributed, public ledger. On-chain transactions are those that have been validated or authenticated and lead to an update to the overall blockchain network.

## Optimistic rollup

Optimistic Rollups (ORs) are one type of layer 2 constructions that do not run on Ethereum's base layer but on top of it. This enables running smart contracts at scale while still being secured by Ethereum.

## Polkadot

Polkadot is an open source, blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that allows for distributed computing. The network uses a proof of stake consensus algorithm. The protocol used, Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension, is derived from Ouroboros.

## Polygon

Polygon is essentially a “Layer 2” network built on the Ethereum blockchain to mitigate the traffic load on the main blockchain.

## POS

Proof of stake protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost of proof of work schemes.

## POW

Proof of work is a form of cryptographic proof in which one party proves to others that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended. Verifiers can subsequently confirm this expenditure with minimal effort on their part.

## React

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read those that are publicly available.

## Wallet address

A wallet address is a randomly generated set of numbers and letters. This set usually consists of 26 to 35 alphanumeric characters. A wallet address is ideally a one-time link generated by a wallet. Wallet addresses are needed to send or receive digital assets.

## WalletConnect
