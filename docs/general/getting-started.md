# Getting Started

Welcome to the CipherShop Documentation!

This documentation is the source of truth about the CipherShop ecosystem. It is a community-focused initiative led by CipherShop Dev Team to keep an up-to-date resource on the best information for learning or maintaining on CipherShop.

The Docs has three main sections: General (to know more about CipherShop ecosystem), Learn (for learners), and Maintain (for people that want to maintain the protocol).

## What is CipherShop?

CipherShop is an automated peer-to-peer decentralized and user-controlled electronic marketplace.

CipherShop allows the purchase and sale of physical and/or digital goods using ETH or tokens compliant with the ERC-20 standard of the Ethereum network.

CipherShop protocol is built on a rollup of layer 2 of Ethereum (initially Polygon), taking into account the avoidance of the use of centralized companies, which have terms of use and control at their mercy the rates and conditions, the avoidance of fraud, the lack of confidence on the part of users when buying directly and avoiding the use of intermediaries as much as possible.

CipherShop is a DAPP based on Ethereum, which aims to expand the cryptocurrency ecosystem, thus being a real and useful alternative to traditional money.

## Why CipherShop?

CipherShop is the first automatic, decentralized and user-governed marketplace for physical goods.

The protocol has been created so that users who buy or sell using the CipherShop protocol will get incentives. This way, the more objects you buy or sell, the more CSHOP tokens you will get, according to your reputation as a seller or buyer, and the more governance power to vote on proposals you will have.

:::info

The CSHOP token is an Ethereum ERC-20 standard whose main goal is to empower users to decide on the future of the protocol.
