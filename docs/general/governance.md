# Governance

## The DAO

:::info

The DAO is based on the original "The DAO" created in 2016, which it's smart contracts bugs provoqued the hard fork of Ethereum, creating Ethereum Classic and the actual Ethereum.

:::

Our DAO, is a major version of the original and adapted to the CipherShop ecosystem. Our DAO has three components: two on-chain and another off-chain.

- **An ethereum ERC-20 standard**, or a token named **CSHOP** (on-chain).

- **A governance system** through which to vote on proposals, with which to: decide to update the protocol, decide which associations to donate or projects to fund, and change aspects of the CipherShop protocol, such as fees (on-chain).

- **A forum** to pre-discuss proposals, see people's decisions and based on this decide whether it is worthwhile or not to make a proposal. Or where to debate about proposals made (off-chain).

## The ERC-20 standard CSHOP

The ERC-20 CSHOP token has been created with one goal in mind: to encourage users to use the protocol, and to allow them to, through the DAO, meet their goals.

> The address of the CSHOP token is: [0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).

The contract has been created from the latest version of OppenZeppelin and modified with the necessary functions.

> To see the smart contract you can access the core repository, and inspect the smart contract itself, [here](https://github.com/CipherShop/core/contracts/tokens/CSHOP.sol).

### Distribution of CSHOP

Initially 1,000,000,000,000 (one billion) CSHOP will be minted, being distributed over 4 years in the following proportions:

- **56% for the community and the community treasury.** At 4 years: 560,000,000 CSHOP.

- **24,333% for the development team.** At 4 years: 243,330,000 CSHOP.

- **18,069% for investors.** At 4 years: 180,690,000 CSHOP.

- **0.968% for small initial investors.** At 4 years: 9,680,000 CSHOP.

- **0.63% for advertisers.** At 4 years: 6,300,000 CSHOP.

A total of 120,000,000 CSHOP will initially be available to the community and the community treasury. Of these, 20,000,000,000 (16.6667%) will be available in the protocol's smart contract, to incentivize users to use the protocol.

As can be seen, there are two phases of attracting investors, the first phase available to any user will aim to raise a minimum amount of capital, to audit the protocol and see vulnerabilities, launch the protocol and hire members for the team, which is currently one person.

:::info
There is a doc section about [joining the team](/docs/maintain/team).
:::

The distribution of CSHOP tokens over the 4 years will be as follows:

- Year 1: 40%

- Year 2: 30%

- Year 3: 20%

- Year 4: 10%

For community and community treasury and small initial investors, the percentage will be calculated by subtracting the total amount over the 4 years established, minus the amount initially available.

After 4 years, there will be an annual inflation rate of 1.6%.

### Investors attraction

In the first distribution to small investors, 2,000,000 CSHOP will be available for direct purchase through a smart contract, thus guaranteeing security. With an initial price of $0.16, with an incremental $0.01 for every 400,000 CSHOP sold.

:::info
This distribution is currently availaible [here](https://ciphershop.org/blog/investors), until the 20 of September 2022.
:::

The second phase of attracting investors will correspond to the official launch of the coin, together with the protocol, once it has been properly audited and tested. With the aim of attracting large investors who want to be part of the project, financing it and helping to create a great ecosystem.

## Governance

By incentivizing users to use the protocol, this would allow the users themselves to control updates to the protocol or changes to the base conditions.

So the protocol would have a governance system in which users with CSHOP could vote on changes or give grants to organizations or fund projects related to CipherShop and thus create a large ecosystem.

To launch a proposal in the governance, at least 100 CSHOPs or delegates are needed. There will be a voting period of 7 days, in which anyone with CSHOP can vote and depending on the type of proposal, if it reaches at least, 500,000 CSHOP votes, own or delegates and 51% positive votes, it will automatically run after 2 days the code to execute the change, if it is a governance change. Since there will be different types of proposals.

## The forum

The forum will be an off-chain system, in which through a traditional registration system, there will be different rooms in which to discuss future proposals, or proposals underway.

A forum room will be able to connect to a proposal automatically, but it will not use smart contracts.
