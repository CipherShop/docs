CipherPunks is a collection of 10,000 randomly generated pixel art NFTs based on the legendary CryptoPunks collection.

Creating an NFT from the CipherPunks collection is currently priced at 0.06 ETH per NFT. You can create up to a maximum of 20 NFTs per Ethereum address.

## How to Create NFTs from the CipherPunks Collection

The creation of the NFTs in the collection is done through a link on the official CipherShop website (click [here](https://ciphershop.org/cipherpunks)).

Before accessing the collection URL, it is recommended to install MetaMask (see [here](https://metamask.io/)) or an Ethereum browser extension. This guide will explain the process using MetaMask.

Alternatively you can use Fortmatic using your email or phone number.

Upon accessing the page, the user will be prompted to unlock MetaMask and link their available Ethereum account to the website.

If all goes well, the purchase section will appear like this:

However, if you have not connected MetaMask correctly, the purchase section will appear as follows and you will have to reload the page for MetaMask to load correctly.

The next step is to select the number of NFTs you want (up to a maximum of 20) and press Mint.

:::note

Currently MetaMask may not estimate the minimum valid rate, so it is recommended to edit the rate manually and try uploading again.

If you cannot see your NFTs, in MetaMask select the NFT option and below press Add NFT and enter the following address: 0x19B9A91A07d5C539f0078768034530370A659d0e and the ID of the NFT you have created.
