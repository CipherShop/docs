# User Guides: Buying CSHOP Tokens in the Initial Private Offering for Small Investors

## Introduction

The CSHOP ERC20 token is available for those who want to enter the category of small initial investors.

:::info

To view the token distribution, please refer to the corresponding section of the documentation [here](/docs/general/governance#distribution-of-cshop).

:::

In the offer for small initial investors, 2,000,000 (two million) tokens are available at an initial price of $0.16 per token. And with an increase of $0.01 for every 400,000 CSHOP tokens purchased.

If you fall into this category (by purchasing tokens), in 4 years, 7,680,000 additional tokens will be distributed, so for every token purchased, after four years you will receive 3.84 additional CSHOP tokens. Following the following rule of three:

```math

x/2,000,000 = y/7,680,000

x = tokens purchased
y = additional tokens to be received

```

## How to Buy Tokens

The purchase of tokens is done in a post on the official CipherShop blog, in the entry "First phase of investor recruitment available now" (click [here](https://ciphershop.org/blog/initial-private-purchase-available)).

Before accessing the purchase URL, it is recommended to install MetaMask (see [here](https://metamask.io/)) or an Ethereum browser extension. This guide will explain the process using MetaMask.

Alternatively you can use Fortmatic using your email or phone number.

Upon accessing the page, the user will be prompted to unlock MetaMask and link their available Ethereum account to the website.

If all goes well, the purchase section will appear like this:

However, if you have not connected MetaMask correctly, the purchase section will appear as follows and you will have to reload the page for MetaMask to load correctly.

The next step is to click on the Invest button.

After clicking the button, a modal will appear where you can enter the amount of CSHOP tokens you wish to purchase.

Currently, the minimum amount of CSHOP tokens that works with MetaMask varies. We are investigating the reason and will update the website as soon as we find a solution.

The ETH fees you see correspond to the price of the tokens plus the fee to successfully complete the transaction.

After a few seconds, you will receive a notification of success or failure. If successful, your tokens will be available in your account and you will be added to the list of small initial investors.

:::note

If you can't see your CSHOP tokens, in MetaMask select import tokens and enter the following address: 0x547B5362a0aA165cF98237C98cdA5A4003f5cA9F.
